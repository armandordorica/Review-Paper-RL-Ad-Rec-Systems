# Introduction: Revision And Reviewer-Risk Audit

Scope: `paper.tex`, `\section{Introduction}` (currently lines 91-121).

Latest refresh: May 17, 2026, first comprehensive audit after the recent revisions to the three-difficulties paragraph (line 100), the SL paradigm paragraph (line 103), the SL-limitations sentence (line 106), the RL-as-solution paragraph (line 109), the gap paragraph opener (line 115), the contributions paragraph (line 118), and the FrozenLake preview removal at line 121.

## Reviewer context used

- Associate Editor: highlight the introductory/tutorial nature of the work targeted at industry practitioners; give clear problem definitions early; distinguish ad-related aspects from general recommender techniques; avoid repetitive material; use bold sparingly.
- Reviewer 1: lack of depth in core content; overemphasis on pedagogical material (Frozen Lake flagged explicitly); evaluation underdeveloped; terminology defined when introduced; reference alignment concerns (including `danescu2010competing` flagged as supporting a different claim than the one it is attached to); limited discussion of joint optimization; reward design / long-term metrics need more concrete grounding.
- Reviewer 2: insufficient emphasis on ad-policies; tighter RL methods coverage; statements about RL adaptability not sufficiently backed by literature; cited works often general RL rather than ad-specific; repeated information across sections; structure and writing need improvement.

## Current Overall Assessment

The introduction is now substantially stronger after the May 17 revision pass. It now:

- frames the problem as joint optimization of monetization and long-term engagement,
- separates three structural difficulties (cannibalization, horizon-observability mismatch, endogeneity) with sharp non-overlap,
- distinguishes the SL paradigm's contribution (paragraph 4) from its structural limitations (paragraph 5),
- positions RL as a complement to SL rather than a substitute, with specific mechanisms named (MDP formalism, off-policy estimators),
- expands the contribution paragraph from a single sentence into a proper three-sentence block with practitioner framing,
- aligns the "unifying taxonomy" terminology across abstract, gap paragraph, and contributions paragraph,
- removes the FrozenLake preview sentence that Reviewer 1 explicitly flagged.

Estimated reviewer-aligned score: **8.5 / 10**, up from roughly 7 / 10 at the start of this revision cycle.

The main remaining risks are:

- Paragraph 7 packs three distinct RL challenges (state/action space, reward design, interpretability) into one block, hurting reader navigation.
- One awkward phrasing ("framework in recommendation systems") in paragraph 6.
- Minor: "real-time" used adverbially where "in real time" is the standard convention.
- Possible bibliography duplication: both `dulac2019challenges` and `dulac2021challenges` are cited in this section.

## Pending Revision Items

### Paragraph length and reader navigation

- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">TODO</span> **I7.** P7 (line 112) is too long and bundles three distinct challenges (state/action space, reward design, interpretability). Options: split into three paragraphs (cleanest); add visible numbering (currently the "First/Second/Furthermore" inline structure is buried in one block); or trim by moving the reward-design subsection content to its dedicated section.

### Phrasing fixes

- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">TODO</span> **I8.** P6 (line 109): *"RL provides a framework in recommendation systems to solve the two problems above"* reads awkwardly. Cleaner: *"RL provides a framework for addressing the two problems above in recommendation systems"* or simply *"RL addresses the two problems above"*.
- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">TODO</span> **I9.** P7 (line 112): *"updated in real-time during user interactions"*. When used adverbially, the unhyphenated *"in real time"* is the standard convention; the hyphenated form is reserved for compound adjectives.

### Bibliography hygiene

- <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P3</span> <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">TODO</span> **I10.** Confirm whether `dulac2019challenges` and `dulac2021challenges` are distinct works that both deserve citation, or whether one supersedes the other. Both appear in the intro: dulac2021 at P7 opener (line 112), dulac2019 at P6 (line 109) and P7 interpretability claim (line 112). If both are legitimately distinct, ensure the choice is consistent across the paper.

### Optional citation-density observation

- <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P3</span> <span style="background:#6c757d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">TODO</span> **I11.** `afsar2022reinforcement` is cited three times in the introduction (P6 framework anchor, P7 dynamic-programming claim, P8 previous-surveys claim). Each use is for a distinct claim, so this is defensible under the citation-audit "distinct facet" rule, but worth flagging as the most-cited source in the introduction.

## Citation Adequacy Scores

Scores use a 1-10 scale:

- 9-10: directly supports the attached claim and is well placed.
- 7-8: mostly appropriate but broad, indirect, or supporting only part of the sentence.
- 5-6: plausible but weakly aligned or too general for the attached claim.
- 1-4: likely mismatched and should be removed or replaced.

| Citation | Uses | Where Used | Adequacy | Assessment |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| `zhao2020jointly` | 1 | P1, joint ad+organic framing | 9 | Direct fit (paper titled "Jointly Learning to Recommend and Advertise"). Anchors the joint-optimization framing the intro builds on. Sole anchor on the opening sentence after I1 resolution. |
| `sagtani2023quantifying` | 2 | P2 ad-fatigue/churn; P3 cannibalization | 9 | Strong ad-policy / industrial source. Distinct claims across the two uses, so the repetition is defensible. |
| `silberstein2023combating` | 1 | P2 ad fatigue | 9 | Direct fit on ad fatigue. |
| `yan2020ads` | 1 | P3 cannibalization | 9 | Strong industrial source on monetization-engagement trade-off (LinkedIn). |
| `hohnhold2015focusing` | 1 | P3 horizon-observability mismatch | 9 | Canonical long-horizon A/B testing source (Google). Direct fit. |
| `wang2022surrogate` | 1 | P3 horizon-observability mismatch | 9 | Direct fit on surrogate metrics for long-term outcomes. |
| `mcdonald2023spotify` | 1 | P3 horizon-observability mismatch | 8 | Strong industrial long-term value source (Spotify). Slightly broader than the specific claim, but appropriate. |
| `zou2019reinforcement` | 1 | P3 endogeneity / feedback | 9 | Direct fit on policy-induced effects in recommender RL. |
| `ie2019reinforcement` | 1 | P3 endogeneity / feedback | 8 | Strong fit (RecSim, simulating policy-induced dynamics). Slightly broader than the specific endogeneity claim but appropriate. |
| `mcmahan2013ad` | 2 | P4 SL paradigm anchor; P4 CTR-specific claim | 9 | Strong industrial CTR source. Per-clause anchoring after recent revision; both uses are distinct. |
| `covington2016deep` | 1 | P4 SL paradigm anchor (YouTube DNN) | 9 | Foundational industrial DL recsys paper. |
| `cheng2016wide` | 2 | P4 SL paradigm anchor; P4 engagement-specific claim | 9 | Strong industrial DL recsys (Wide & Deep, Google Play). Both uses are distinct after recent revision. |
| `yi2014beyond` | 1 | P4 dwell-time signal | 9 | Direct fit on the dwell-time signal mention. |
| `naumov2019deep` | 1 | P4 industrial backbone claim | 9 | Meta DLRM. Strong industrial-backbone anchor for the closing sentence of P4. |
| `swaminathan2015counterfactual` | 2 | P5 distribution shift; P6 off-policy estimators | 9 | Direct fit on both counterfactual evaluation and policy-induced distribution shift. Distinct claims across the two uses. |
| `dudik2011doubly` | 1 | P5 distribution shift | 9 | Doubly robust estimators. Strong canonical fit. |
| `agarwal2016statistical` | 1 | P5 outcomes are policy-dependent | 9 | Microsoft Decision Service. Strong fit for policy-dependent outcomes claim. |
| `afsar2022reinforcement` | 3 | P6 RL framework; P7 dynamic-programming infeasibility; P8 previous surveys | 8 | Strong RL recsys survey. All three uses are for distinct claims, but this is the most-cited source in the intro. Monitor. See I11. |
| `Sutton1998` | 1 | P6 MDP formalism | 9 | Foundational. Single use after recent citation cleanup. |
| `chen2022off` | 1 | P6 SL+RL embedding | 9 | Direct ad/recsys example of supervised function approximation embedded in off-policy actor-critic. |
| `dulac2019challenges` | 2 | P6 deep+RL machinery; P7 explainable RL interpretability | 7 | Defensible but broad. Each use is distinct. See I10 about possible duplication with `dulac2021challenges`. |
| `levine2020offline` | 1 | P6 deep+RL machinery | 9 | Offline RL tutorial. Strong fit. |
| `dulac2021challenges` | 1 | P7 RL real-world complexity | 8 | Updated journal version. Strong fit for the broad implementation-complexity claim. See I10 for the consistency concern with `dulac2019challenges`. |
| `zhu2021overview` | 1 | P7 infinite state/action spaces | 7 | Broad RL overview. Acceptable for the infinite-spaces claim, but a more recsys-specific source would strengthen it. |
| `everitt2021reward` | 1 | P7 reward function importance | 8 | Reward hacking / reward design source. Good fit for the broad reward-design importance claim. |
| `wu2017returning` | 1 | P7 clickbait/CTR pitfall | 8 | Recommender system source on returning users / CTR optimization pitfalls. Good fit for the clickbait example. |
| `sagtani2024ad` | 1 | P7 over-monetization / excessive ad load | 9 | Direct fit. Industrial ad-load balancing paper (Spotify, WSDM 2024) whose entire motivation is the exact reward-design trade-off the sentence describes. Added during I2 resolution; not used elsewhere in the intro. |
| `glanois2024survey` | 1 | P7 explainable RL | 8 | Explainable RL survey. Strong fit for the interpretability claim, paired appropriately with other explainability sources. |
| `vouros2022explainable` | 1 | P7 explainable RL | 8 | Same family as `glanois2024survey`. Both citations together substantiate the explainability claim across distinct angles (general survey + specifically explainable RL). |
| `lambert2023entangled` | 1 | P7 non-compliant / unethical behavior | 8 | Reward hacking / unintended-behavior source. Good fit for the hedged "extreme cases" claim. |
| `lin2023survey` | 1 | P8 previous surveys | 9 | Direct fit (RL recommender systems survey). Used alongside `afsar2022reinforcement` to establish the "previous surveys exist" claim. |

**Citation tally**

- Unique citations in the introduction: 31.
- Total citation tokens: 36.
- Re-cited sources: `afsar2022reinforcement` (3), and `sagtani2023quantifying`, `mcmahan2013ad`, `cheng2016wide`, `swaminathan2015counterfactual`, `dulac2019challenges` (2 each).
- All multi-use citations are currently attached to distinct claims (per the §7.1 "distinct facet" rule), so the repetition is defensible — but `afsar2022reinforcement` at 3 uses is at the upper bound and worth monitoring.

## Resolved Revision Items

Status assessed against the current introduction on May 17, 2026.

- <span style="background:#7c1d1d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P0</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **I1.** Removed `danescu2010competing` from paragraph 1 (line 91), leaving `zhao2020jointly` as the sole on-claim anchor for the joint monetization and engagement framing. The Danescu et al. paper studies organic vs sponsored search results in 2010-era search engines, which Reviewer 1 flagged as misaligned with the attached claim about modern feed recommenders. In the same pass, the platform-name list (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest) was replaced with the generic phrase *"Large-scale content recommendation platforms in industry"*, since the named platforms were not all grounded by other citations in the paper (Pinterest in particular had no supporting citations elsewhere).
- <span style="background:#7c1d1d;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P0</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **I2.** Anchored the previously uncited over-monetization claim in paragraph 7 (line 109) with `sagtani2024ad`, the Spotify ad-load balancing paper (WSDM 2024). The paper directly studies the reward-design trade-off the sentence describes — naive revenue maximization in the learning objective leads to bad ad-load outcomes that degrade user engagement. Single anchor chosen for parallelism with `wu2017returning` in the preceding sentence; no redundancy introduced (first use of `sagtani2024ad` in the intro).
- <span style="background:#dc3545;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P1</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **I3.** Replaced *"designing appropriate reward functions is critical"* with *"designing appropriate reward functions is non-trivial"* at paragraph 7 (line 109). Removes the extreme adjective flagged by `revision_rules.md` §1; the trailing *"as poorly chosen reward functions can lead to..."* clause continues to carry the empirical grounding via `everitt2021reward`. The new adjective aligns with vocabulary used elsewhere in the introduction (P3 *"structurally difficult"*, P5 *"structurally insufficient"*).
- <span style="background:#dc3545;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P1</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **I4.** Removed the summary sentence *"Striking the right balance in reward function design is essential to achieve both user engagement and monetization objectives without compromising the platform's long-term goals"* from paragraph 7 (line 109). The sentence was redundant with the two contrasting examples that preceded it (clickbait extreme via `wu2017returning`, over-monetization extreme via `sagtani2024ad`), which already convey "balance matters" by demonstration. Removal eliminates both the extreme word *"essential"* and the absolute *"without compromising"* clause in one stroke, partially advances I7 (paragraph length), and leaves *"Furthermore, interpretability is a major challenge in RL deployment"* as a clean transition.
- <span style="background:#dc3545;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P1</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **I5 + I6.** Merged the two single-sentence opening paragraphs (former P1 at line 91 and former P2 at line 94) into a single problem-and-stakes paragraph by removing the blank line between them. The source-level section comments (`%What is the problem`, `% What happens if problem isn't solved`) are preserved as inline structural notes; in LaTeX comments do not break paragraphs, so the rendered output is now one paragraph. The merged paragraph leads naturally into the *"Jointly optimizing revenue and long-term engagement is structurally difficult..."* paragraph that follows.
- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R1.** Three-difficulties paragraph (P3, line 100) refactored from three vague difficulties to three sharply non-overlapping points (cannibalization, horizon-observability mismatch, endogeneity). Endogeneity term introduced with inline gloss.
- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R2.** SL paradigm paragraph (P4, line 103): trimmed repeated citations (`covington2016deep` 3 to 1, `cheng2016wide` 3 to 1), softened "supervised deep learning" to "supervised machine learning" so `mcmahan2013ad` (FTRL/LR) is no longer mis-shelved, split per-clause anchor in S3, added `naumov2019deep` for industrial-backbone claim.
- <span style="background:#dc3545;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P1</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R3.** SL-limitations closing sentence (P5, line 106) rewritten from ambiguous "Long-term outcomes are not fixed labels but functions of the policy" to clear "Long-term outcomes therefore depend not only on the current state-action pair but also on the policy that generates the subsequent trajectory."
- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R4.** RL-as-solution paragraph (P6, line 109): S2 "addresses" softened to "explicitly represents... providing the framework within which RL algorithms can account for this dependence"; S3 rewritten to actually address counterfactual evaluation via off-policy estimators (now parallels SL "Second" critique); S4 SL+RL framing changed from "rather than replacing" with `chen2022off` as the load-bearing recsys anchor; citation cleanup (9 tokens to 6, each cite appearing once).
- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R5.** Gap paragraph opener (P8, line 115) updated to name the MDP elements and policy learning as the unifying taxonomy axes, replacing "through the lens of" framing.
- <span style="background:#dc3545;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P1</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R6.** Contributions paragraph (P9, line 118) expanded from a single sentence into a three-sentence block: taxonomy + 150 works (with grammar fix "a component-level taxonomy"), synthesis dimensions, practitioner audience.
- <span style="background:#fd7e14;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">P2</span> <span style="background:#198754;color:white;padding:2px 8px;border-radius:4px;font-weight:bold">DONE</span> **R7.** FrozenLake preview sentence removed from structure paragraph (P10, line 121) per Reviewer 1's explicit feedback. Note: line 133 mention and the comparison table at lines 135-176 still reference FrozenLake; coordinated cleanup deferred pending the toy-example replacement decision.
